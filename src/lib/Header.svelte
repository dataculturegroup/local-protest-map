          Protests have begun in earnest again since President Trump was elected, but happen on all sorts of topics.

          Clicking a pin on the map shows a short summary of what the protest was about. The underlying data is from two
          external groups that track protests: the 
          <a href="https://acleddata.com/" target=_new>Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)</a> and 
          the <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/programs/crowd-counting-consortium/" target=_new>Crowd Counting Consortium (CCC)</a>.
